# Frontend Implementation Plan for MBS Coding Assistant (Simplified Vercel Approach)

## Overview
This plan focuses on building a beautiful, UI-focused React frontend for the MBS Coding Assistant using Vercel's deployment platform. The backend API is already deployed and operational at `https://mbs-rag-api-736900516853.australia-southeast1.run.app`.

## Project Context
- **Backend Status**: ✅ Complete and deployed (Hours 1-13 completed)
- **API Endpoint**: Production API available on Google Cloud Run
- **Frontend Goal**: Build a clean, responsive React interface with minimal complexity
- **Tech Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Native Fetch API
- **Deployment**: Vercel (free tier, handles CORS/caching/SSL)

## Key Simplifications
- ✅ **No complex API service layer** - Just a simple fetch wrapper
- ✅ **No frontend caching** - Vercel handles edge caching
- ✅ **No Axios needed** - Native fetch is sufficient
- ✅ **Focus on UI/UX** - 90% effort on user experience
- ✅ **Leverage Vercel** - Use platform features instead of building them

{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/:path*",
      "destination": "https://mbs-rag-api-736900516853.australia-southeast1.run.app/api/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Clean component composition
- ~150 lines total

vercel.json
- API rewrites configuration
- Headers for caching
- Environment variable setup
```

**Deployment Steps**:
1. `npm run build` - Create production build
2. `vercel` - Deploy to Vercel (automatic)
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard

## Simplified Architecture

```
User → React App → Vercel Edge → Backend API
         ↓           ↓              ↓
    Simple UI    Handles CORS   Already Built
                 & Caching
```

### What We're NOT Building:
- ❌ Complex state management (Redux, MobX)
- ❌ Frontend caching logic (Vercel handles it)
- ❌ Request retry mechanisms (keep it simple)

- ❌ Complex routing (single page is enough)
- ❌ Authentication (not needed yet)

### What We ARE Building:
- ✅ Beautiful, intuitive UI
- ✅ Smooth loading animations
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Fast, simple API integration
- ✅ One-click deployment

- Handle SSL certificates
- Manage CORS with rewrites
- Cache at the edge
- Auto-deploy on git push

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Now):
   - Complete simple API wrapper
   - Create Vercel configuration
   - Start building UI components

2. **Today**:
   - Complete all core components
   - Style the application
   - Deploy to Vercel

3. **Tomorrow**:
   - Test with real API
   - Polish based on testing
   - Share for feedback

---

## Key Decisions

- **Use Vercel**: Free, handles infrastructure complexity
- **Native fetch**: No need for Axios
- **Simple state**: useState is enough, no Redux needed
- **CSS Modules**: Simple, performant styling
- **Focus on UI**: Make it beautiful and intuitive
- **Ship fast**: Get it working, then iterate

---

## Notes

- Backend API is fully functional at the production URL
- Vercel's free tier is perfect for this project
- Keep everything as simple as possible
- Focus on user experience over technical complexity
- Ship early, iterate based on real user feedback
