- Initial run slow due to embedding computation (16-20s for 6000 codes)
- Global variable scoping issues in Python (needed explicit global declarations)

**Key learning:**
- Always create project-specific virtual environments with UV
- Medical models (BioBERT) are great but general models (MiniLM) work well enough
- Pre-computing embeddings at startup is worth the initial delay

**Key learning:**
- Focus on fields actually used by downstream components (YAGNI principle)
- O(1) lookups worth the extra memory for 6000 items (89KB + 205KB indexes)
- Regex patterns for medical text need careful ordering and IGNORECASE flag
- Dictionary memory usage ~3x lists but performance gains justify it
