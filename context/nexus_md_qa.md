 Sample data: NexusMD will provide some case data, though not a large amount — around 10 cases. We don’t have much case data available since real-world data is very valuable. I will also include some reference materials. I expect to send these to you tomorrow after an internal review. My workload has been heavy the past couple of days, so time for this has been limited. 
  
 Target end users: The intended users are hospital staff, specifically the coding department. Doctors usually don’t do coding themselves; instead, after consultations are completed, staff members collect relevant materials and perform coding. This process is directly tied to hospitals claiming revenue from insurance companies or Medicare. 
  
 Approach: NexusMD is open to different methods — the key is the reasoning. Given the small amount of data, supervised learning could be challenging due to annotation requirements. From a feasibility standpoint, using large language models may be more practical. That said, if supervised learning can be applied successfully, we would of course welcome that. 
  
 Deliverable expectations: The best outcome would be a working demo. With so many AI-assisted coding tools available, a team that can effectively leverage these to deliver a functioning demo would be ideal. If that’s not possible, a well-documented solution with partial implementation (combining a proposal and code snippets) would also be acceptable. Pure model-based solutions — whether a custom-trained supervised model or a fine-tuned coding model — are also fine. I will evaluate based on technical challenge: the higher the difficulty of the chosen approach, the lower the required completeness; conversely, if the approach is simpler, I expect higher completeness.
