# AutoMBS: AI-Powered Medicare Benefits Schedule Coding Assistant

*AI NextGen Challenge - NexuMD Submission*

## Executive Summary

AutoMBS is a proof-of-concept AI system developed during a time-constrained hackathon to demonstrate automated MBS code selection from clinical documentation. The system showcases a 5-stage AI pipeline that processes consultation notes and suggests appropriate MBS billing codes with reasoning and confidence scores.

Built with React TypeScript frontend and Python FastAPI backend, this prototype demonstrates the feasibility of AI-assisted Medicare billing code selection for Australian healthcare providers.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare providers in Australia face significant challenges with MBS coding:

- **Manual Process**: Current MBS code selection is entirely manual, requiring extensive medical billing knowledge
- **Time Consuming**: Staff spend considerable time researching appropriate codes for each consultation
- **Error Prone**: Manual selection leads to coding errors, claim rejections, and potential compliance issues
- **Resource Intensive**: Requires specialized billing expertise that may not be available in all practices
- **Complexity**: 5,964+ MBS codes across multiple categories with complex eligibility rules

## Solution Overview

AutoMBS provides an intelligent, end-to-end system that:

1. **Ingests clinical documentation** via a user-friendly web interface
2. **Applies comprehensive MBS knowledge base** with real-time processing
3. **Generates candidate MBS codes** using AI-powered analysis
4. **Provides detailed reasoning** for each recommendation
5. **Includes confidence scores** for decision support
6. **Validates compliance** against Additional Notes rules

### Core Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite 5 for fast development and building
- Axios for API communication
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

**Backend:**
- Python 3.13 with FastAPI for high-performance APIs
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for medical reasoning
- Sentence Transformers for semantic understanding
- Comprehensive caching and optimization

**Deployment:**
- Docker containerization
- Google Cloud Run for scalable hosting
- Automated CI/CD pipeline ready

## How the System Works

### 5-Stage AI Pipeline

1. **Stage 0: Intelligent Categorization**
   - LLM analyzes consultation context (GP, ED, specialist, etc.)
   - Reduces search space by 75-90% (6,000 â†’ 600-1,500 codes)
   - Rule-based fallback for reliability

2. **Stage 1: TF-IDF Text Filtering**
   - Extracts medical terms using regex patterns
   - Performs text similarity matching
   - Reduces to top 50 candidates (0.001s after caching)

3. **Stage 2: Semantic Embedding Ranking**
   - Uses pre-computed medical language model embeddings
   - Performs semantic similarity analysis
   - Narrows to top 20 candidates (<500ms)

4. **Stage 3: LLM Medical Reasoning**
   - GPT-4o-mini applies medical billing expertise
   - Considers Additional Notes compliance rules
   - Provides detailed medical justification
   - Generates final 3-5 recommendations (10-30s)

5. **Stage 4: Compliance Validation**
   - Validates age restrictions and setting requirements
   - Checks co-claim rules and exclusions
   - Adds compliance warnings where applicable
   - Enriches recommendations with eligibility status

### Performance (Prototype Testing)

- **Processing Time**: 10-30 seconds for new requests, <100ms for cached responses
- **LLM Confidence**: ~80% average self-assessed confidence scores
- **Coverage**: 5,964 MBS codes across all medical categories
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests for core functionality

*Note: Performance metrics are from limited prototype testing, not production validation*

## How to Use AutoMBS

   - Enter clinical documentation (10-10,000 characters)
   - Select consultation context (GP, ED, specialist, etc.)
   - Configure options (max codes, confidence threshold)

3. **Review Recommendations**
   - Examine suggested MBS codes with confidence scores
   - Read detailed medical reasoning for each recommendation
   - Check compliance warnings and eligibility status
   - Access direct links to MBS Online for official descriptions

4. **Make Informed Decisions**
   - Use AI recommendations as decision support
   - Apply professional medical billing expertise
   - Verify all codes before submission to Medicare

### For Developers

1. **API Integration**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://mbs-rag-api-736900516853.australia-southeast1.run.app/api/v1/analyze" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "consultation_note": "45-minute comprehensive consultation...",
       "options": {"max_codes": 5, "min_confidence": 0.6}
     }'
   ```
