- `src/components/ConsultationInput/ConsultationInput.css` - Fixed spacing issues
- `src/components/ConsultationInput/ConsultationInput.test.tsx` - Enhanced TDD test suite

### üêõ Fixed - UI and UX Issues

#### **Validation UX Improvements**
- **Issue**: Validation errors shown before user interaction
- **Solution**: Added `hasUserInteracted` state to delay error display until user starts typing
- **Approach**: Test-driven development with comprehensive test coverage

#### **Layout Spacing Fixes**
- **Issue**: Large gap between description text and dropdown
- **Solution**: Reduced `.input-header` margin from `var(--spacing-xl)` to `var(--spacing-md)`
- **Testing**: Visual regression tests and layout validation

#### **Missing Label Confirmation**
- **Issue**: User reported missing consultation context label
- **Solution**: Confirmed label exists ("Consultation Context") and added test coverage
